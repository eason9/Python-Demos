    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high level, general purpose programming language whose typical implementation (CPython) is built on top of the much lower general purpose programming language of C.  There are other implementations (IronPython, Jython, PyPy, Stackless Python, etc.), but because most modern OSs are written in C, the Python compiler/interpreter you are most likely to use is also written in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted langage, meaning its implementations execute instructions directly and without requiring any compiling of the program into machine-language.  This means that when Python code is executed the i|nterpreter translates each statement directly into a sequence of one or more subroutines and then into another language (usually C in our case).  Basically, Pything being an interpreted language means you don't have to compile your code before you run it."

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "Simply because the python language is unmatched in its developmental efficiency.  Often other languages, especially if they are lower level languages, are more efficient during execution of their instructions as compared to Python.  But, it often takes 10 developers in other languages to do the work that 1 Python developer can do in the same amount of time.  Said differently, because Python is easy."

    "Installing Anaconda will provide you access to Python through two IDEs that come with the distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in Python consists of two key tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A text editor to write code into.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A Python interpreter to execute code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any integrated development environment (IDE) these are the two most important pieces that need to be identified before you can begin coding.  In Jupyter NoteBooks finding these is easy, the text editor is indicated by,\n",
    "\n",
    "`In[]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "and the code is automatically passed to the interpreter and executed after the code in the text editor is ran.  This results in the output of the executed code as,\n",
    "\n",
    "`Out[]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the numbers that appear are the input line counters and keep track of the sequence in which code has been executed, e.g.\n",

    "`In[9]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Out[9]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "Signifies the 9th execution of instructions by the interpreter.  Keeping track of how you execute your code is extremely important in Jupyter NoteBooks because code can be executed in a non-sequential fasion and can result in errors.  Pay attention to the order in which you run your code or it will not work diretly when you come back to it."

Python is a fairly unique language in that child code blocks are denoted through whitespace indentation of lines (as opposed to using an explicit delimiter e.g. `{` and `}`).  Code blocks are important because they clearly express how certain lines of code are connected.  In Python, technically any amount of whitespace denotes the move to a new child block, but the standard is to use one `TAB` (or four whitespaces) to denote a new child block.  This makes code very readable and quick to construct.  The following advanced syntax topics all use parent and child blocks in thier syntax.\n",
